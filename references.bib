	abstract = "ABSTRACT The design and performance results of indoor geolocation using very high frequency (VHF) spread spectrum signals and plans for future improvements are presented. The development of the system is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense to support small unit operations in urban environments. In the present system, direct-sequence spread spectrum signals at 258.5 MHz carrier frequency and 23.5 MHz chipping rate are generated and transmitted by a small hand-held, battery-operated transmitter inside the building. The signal is received by four or more receivers located external to the building. The signals are downconverted and digitized at 8 bits and 94 MHz. The cross-correlation envelope is calculated using fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques. The leading edge of the cross-correlation envelope is fit to a template cross-correlation obtained in the absence of multipath to extract the time of arrival (TOA) of the signal. Even in a modern office building with a corrugated steel roof, where the indirect path is orders of magnitude greater than the direct path, we are able to reliably track the leading edge of the direct path. In data collected thus far, we have been able to obtain horizontal accuracy within 3 m of ground truth in 90 percent of the fixes. TOA information is passed to a central computer via a wireless network for processing and plotting fixes in real time with a 1.7 s update rate."

In our approach the physical properties of the signal propagation are not taken into account directly. Instead the location estimation is regarded as a machine learning problem in which the task is to model how the signal strengths are distributed in different geographical areas based on a sample of measurements collected at several known locations. We present a probabilistic framework for solving the location estimation problem. In the empirical part of the paper we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by reporting results of field tests in which a probabilistic location estimation method is validated in a real-world indoor environment.",

	abstract = "Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence."

	abstract="We investigate the properties of a metric between two distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for content-based image retrieval. The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.",
